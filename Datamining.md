# What is DATA MINING? 

There is a huge amount of data available in the Information Industry. This data is of no use until it is converted into useful information. It is necessary to analyze this huge amount of data and extract useful information from it.

Data mining is one of the most useful techniques that help entrepreneurs, researchers, and individuals to extract valuable information from huge sets of data. Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). The knowledge discovery process includes Data cleaning, Data integration, Data selection, Data transformation, Data mining, Pattern evaluation, and Knowledge presentation. Once all these processes are over, we would be able to use this information in many applications such as Fraud Detection, Market Analysis, Production Control, Science Exploration, etc.

# The whole process of Data Mining consists of three main phases: 

- Data Pre-processing – Data cleaning, integration, selection, and transformation takes place
- Data Extraction – Occurrence of exact data mining
- Data Evaluation and Presentation – Analyzing and presenting results 

# Data Mining History

For millennia, people have excavated places to find hidden mysteries. "Knowledge discovery in databases" refers to the act of sifting through data to uncover hidden relationships and forecast future trends. In the 1990s, the phrase "data mining" was invented. Data mining emerged from the convergence of three scientific disciplines: artificial intelligence, machine learning, and statistics.

Artificial intelligence is the human-like intelligence demonstrated by software and machines,  machine learning is the term used to describe algorithms that can learn from data to create predictions, and statistics is the numerical study of data correlations.

Data mining takes advantage of big data's infinite possibilities and inexpensive processing power. Processing power and speed have grown significantly in the recent decade, allowing the globe to undertake rapid, easy, and automated data analysis.

# Types of Data Mining

Data mining can be performed on the following types of data:

- Relational Database:

A relational database is a collection of multiple data sets formally organized by tables, records, and columns from which data can be accessed in various ways without having to recognize the database tables. Tables convey and share information, which facilitates data searchability, reporting, and organization.

- Data warehouses:

A Data Warehouse is the technology that collects the data from various sources within the organization to provide meaningful business insights. The huge amount of data comes from multiple places such as Marketing and Finance. The extracted data is utilized for analytical purposes and helps in decision- making for a business organization. The data warehouse is designed for the analysis of data rather than transaction processing.

- Data Repositories:

The Data Repository generally refers to a destination for data storage. However, many IT professionals utilize the term more clearly to refer to a specific kind of setup within an IT structure. For example, a group of databases, where an organization has kept various kinds of information.

- Object-Relational Database:

A combination of an object-oriented database model and relational database model is called an object-relational model. It supports Classes, Objects, Inheritance, etc.

One of the primary objectives of the Object-relational data model is to close the gap between the Relational database and the object-oriented model practices frequently utilized in many programming languages, for example, C++, Java, C#, and so on.

- Transactional Database:

A transactional database refers to a database management system (DBMS) that has the potential to undo a database transaction if it is not performed appropriately. Even though this was a unique capability a very long while back, today, most of the relational database systems support transactional database activities.


# Data Mining Steps
When asking “what is data mining,” let’s break it down into the steps data scientists and analysts take when tackling a data mining project.

1. Understand Business 
What is the company’s current situation, the project’s objectives, and what defines success?

2. Understand the Data
Figure out what kind of data is needed to solve the issue, and then collect it from the proper sources.

3. Prepare the Data
Resolve data quality problems like duplicate, missing, or corrupted data, then prepare the data in a format suitable to resolve the business problem.

4. Model the Data
Employ algorithms to ascertain data patterns. Data scientists create, test, and evaluate the model.

5. Evaluate the Data
Decide whether and how effective the results delivered by a particular model will help meet the business goal or remedy the problem. Sometimes there’s an iterative phase for finding the best algorithm, especially if the data scientists don’t get it quite right the first time. There may be some data mining algorithms shopping around.

6. Deploy the Solution
Give the results of the project to the people in charge of making decisions.

# There are several benefits of data mining, including:

- Improved decision making: Data mining can provide valuable insights that can help organizations make better decisions by identifying patterns and trends in large data sets.
- Increased efficiency: Data mining can automate repetitive and time-consuming tasks, such as data cleaning and preparation, which can help organizations save time and resources.
- Enhanced competitiveness: Data mining can help organizations gain a competitive edge by uncovering new business opportunities and identifying areas for improvement.
- Improved customer service: Data mining can help organizations better understand their customers and tailor their products and services to meet their needs.
- Fraud detection: Data mining can be used to identify fraudulent activities by detecting unusual patterns and anomalies in data.
- Predictive modeling: Data mining can be used to build models that can predict future events and trends, which can be used to make proactive decisions.
- New product development: Data mining can be used to identify new product opportunities by analyzing customer purchase patterns and preferences.
- Risk management: Data mining can be used to identify potential risks by analyzing data on customer behavior, market conditions, and other factors.

# Data Mining Applications

- Data Mining in Healthcare:

Data mining in healthcare has excellent potential to improve the health system. It uses data and analytics for better insights and to identify best practices that will enhance health care services and reduce costs. Analysts use data mining approaches such as Machine learning, Multi-dimensional database, Data visualization, Soft computing, and statistics. Data Mining can be used to forecast patients in each category. The procedures ensure that the patients get intensive care at the right place and at the right time. Data mining also enables healthcare insurers to recognize fraud and abuse.

- Data Mining in Market Basket Analysis:

Market basket analysis is a modeling method based on a hypothesis. If you buy a specific group of products, then you are more likely to buy another group of products. This technique may enable the retailer to understand the purchase behavior of a buyer. This data may assist the retailer in understanding the requirements of the buyer and altering the store's layout accordingly. Using a different analytical comparison of results between various stores, between customers in different demographic groups can be done.

- Data Mining in Lie Detection:

Apprehending a criminal is not a big deal, but bringing out the truth from him is a very challenging task. Law enforcement may use data mining techniques to investigate offenses, monitor suspected terrorist communications, etc. This technique includes text mining also, and it seeks meaningful patterns in data, which is usually unstructured text. The information collected from the previous investigations is compared, and a model for lie detection is constructed.

- Data Mining Financial Banking:

The Digitalization of the banking system is supposed to generate an enormous amount of data with every new transaction. The data mining technique can help bankers by solving business-related problems in banking and finance by identifying trends, casualties, and correlations in business information and market costs that are not instantly evident to managers or executives because the data volume is too large or are produced too rapidly on the screen by experts. The manager may find these data for better targeting, acquiring, retaining, segmenting, and maintain a profitable customer.

- Data Mining in Fraud detection:

Billions of dollars are lost to the action of frauds. Traditional methods of fraud detection are a little bit time consuming and sophisticated. Data mining provides meaningful patterns and turning data into information. An ideal fraud detection system should protect the data of all the users. Supervised methods consist of a collection of sample records, and these records are classified as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. A model is constructed using this data, and the technique is made to identify whether the document is fraudulent or not
